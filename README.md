# discordcavebot
A bot with a story in a game for Discord Hack Week :)

I can't add in the node modules because there are too many modules. You may have to install the certain packages in package.json for this to work.

Hope you enjoy the project though, just input your testing token at the end of the code and your good to go! Don't delete anything in datas.json either please :)

This project has gone thru multiple names, GamerBot -> CaveBot -> DiscordCave
just so you know!
